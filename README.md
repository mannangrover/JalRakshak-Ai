JalRakshak AI – Smart Water Distribution & Leakage Management (Digital Twin + DSS)

Urban water distribution in many Indian cities still runs on fixed schedules with limited real-time monitoring, leading to massive losses through leakages and non-revenue water (NRW).



What we built:
A Digital Twin + Decision Support System (DSS) that simulates and monitors ward-wise water supply to enable demand-based distribution and proactive leakage detection.

Deployment: We deployed and published the complete website on Vercel for fast, reliable hosting and easy public access.
